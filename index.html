<p>As I read Chapter 2 of The Pragmatic Programmer, I learned about techniques used to improve coding, but I felt like it wasn't too clear as to what each method really was. For example, I know what the intention of tracer code is, but I don't know what tracer code looks like because there was never any demonstration of what it looked like in a program. It turns into a problem where I can't just learn those concepts by looking at them and absorbing the knowledge, I have to see them in action in order to see how they work. Despite these difficulties, I was still able to separate the tricks leaned from this chapter into two categories: Tricks that make your code better, and tricks that make your code more predictable. The first category involves tricks such as making sure no two methods do the same thing and making methods only affect what they're supposed to affect, thus making it easier to point out where a bug is and fix it without causing additional issues. The other category involves tricks such as tracer code or prototyping that help find bugs in the code, allowing for a single flaw to be found in a program that gets increasingly complex as it continues to grow. Single parts of a program can be tested with prototyping, and errors can be found more easily with tracer code to ensure that bugs are quickly found. But despite the separate categories, the tricks both have one common goal in mind: To get rid of bugs quickly and with no trouble.</p>
